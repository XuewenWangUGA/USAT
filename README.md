# USAT
Universal STR allele Toolkit

USAT is a bioinformatic software with a graphic interface for universal Short Tandem Repeat (STR) allele manipulation toolkit. It is free for all acdemic and educational purposes. Industrial and business users need to obtain license. Please contact me for more information.
The USAT is full programmed in Java and, it is ready for running with mouse clicks only after downloading this software,so no installation is needed. 

## Installation and run
 Download the software into your computer and put in a directory called "usat". Double click the USAT.jar to run. This software will use a new version of Java runtime enviroment V17. If your computer has an older version, please install the newest Java runtime enviroment V17 or higher from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows 



## Format of sequence file:
USAT takes a sequence file with haplotype sequence for each STR and an optional BED file for specific information at each loci.
The format is a tabular text file with data like marker1<tab>haplotype sequence, one haplotype per line. If there are multiple haplotypes, the same marker ID could be used for each locus. e.g.
  MK1 CTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTAT
  MK1 CTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTAT
  
  A test dataset come with the software release for testing.
