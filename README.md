# USAT
## Universal STR Allele Toolkit (USAT)

USAT is a bioinformatic software with a graphic interface for universal Tandem Repeat (TR) including short TR (STR). It is free for all acdemic and educational purposes. Industrial and business users need to obtain license. Please contact for more information.
The USAT is full programmed in Java and, it is ready for running with mouse clicks only after downloading this software,so no installation is needed.

Latest version: v1.1

## License

A license is needed to be obtained from us for any industrial and any other purposes. Please contact us.


## Functions of USAT
USAT has many functions for haplotype comparison, plot, and visualizion for detailed TR haplotype comparison to provide informative clues of difference between any alleles, including

1. TR allele interactibe viewing, sorting, filtering 
2. Graphic plot the distribution of alleles and comparison
3. Haplotype sequence alignment and comprison
4. Caculation of allele length in bp to the number of repeat time  (allele size)

## Installation
### Step 1. Download the software from Github
 
 `git clone https://github.com/XuewenWangUGA/USAT`
 
 `cd USAT`
 
 or use the github click to download button.
 <br/>
 
 ### Step 2. Get demo and settings 
  
  Download the subdirectories `testData` and put `testData` under the directory USAT
                  
  Download the subdirectories `settings` and put `settings` under the directory USAT
  
  This step is for demo data and demo settings.
   <br/>
                  
###  Step 3. Get or update the dependency
 
 #### For Windows user:
 
 Download maffinwin from https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/windows_without_cygwin.html  and unzip the download files into `maffinwin` under the directory USAT. 
  <br/>
 
#### For Linux and MacOS: 
 
Donwload the Linux installation file from https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/linux.html and install it. After that, to export the mafft path into environment.

Donwload the MacOS installation file from https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/macosx.html and install it. After that, to export the mafft path into environment.

Command to export path: 

assume you installed the mafft and the bin excutable is in the direct called /your/path/to/mafft/

`export PATH=$PATH: /your/path/to/mafft/`
 
 <br/> 
 
 or download whole package from Github https://github.com/ge-lab using Github download button.
 
 
 #### Update Java run enviroment if necessary
 This software will use a new version of Java runtime enviroment V17. If your computer has an older version, please install the newest Java runtime enviroment V17 or higher from  https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/  . Either Java JDK or SE should works.

 
 ## Run USAT
 
 method 1: Go to the USAT folder, double click the USAT.jar to run
 
 or mehotd 2 in command terminal, type 
 
` java -jar USAT.jar`

## Format of haplotype sequence as the 1st input file
USAT takes a sequence file with haplotype sequence(s) for each TR or STR.
The format is a tabular text file with data like marker1 <tab> haplotype sequence <tab> SampleID, one haplotype per line. If there are multiple haplotypes, the same marker ID could be used for each locus. Lines with # can be used annotation or comments which will be ignored by USAT. 
 
 e.g.,
 #CODIS core STR loci for HG002		
 
#Marker_Name	Sample_haplotype	SampleID
 
  MK1 CTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTAT S1
 
  MK1 CTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTAT S0
  
  A test dataset is provided with the software release.
 

## Format of the BED file as the 2nd input file
 USAT take a  BED file for specific information at each locus
 The locus information is given in BED format in plain text file (https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1). Fields are separated by a tab. It starts with a head line  with "Chrom" and then one TR marker locus per line. Multiple marker loci can be put in a file, just put in subsequent lines. e.g.,
 
 |Chrom	| ChromStart |	ChromEnd  | Name	   |Left_offset	|Right_offset	|Basic_motif_period	|Ref_hap_length	|  Motif	                     |Ref_allele	|Inner_offset	| Min_stutter_threshold |
 |:---- |  -------:  |  -------: | :-----: |   -------: |    -------: |          -------: |         ----: | :-------------------------: |      ---: |        ---: |                      ---: |
 |chr1	 |  230769615	| 230769683 |	D1S1656 |         3	 |           3	|                 4	|            68	|   CCTA[TCTA]nTCA[TCTA]n 	|        17 |           0 |                      0.1  |

 If you don't know the value of some columns, you can put 1. However, the first four columns must be unique across all TR loci.
